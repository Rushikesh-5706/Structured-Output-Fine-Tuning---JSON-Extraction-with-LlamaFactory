## Model's Actual Output

[Paste the verbatim raw model output here after running inference]

## What Went Wrong

[Describe the exact failure after running inference. Expected issues: very large INR
values in crore format (4,55,00,000.00 = 4.55 crore = 45,500,000.00), date ambiguity
with DD/MM format, and the parenthetical note "including applicable taxes" on total.]

## Why It Likely Failed

The crore-scale Indian number format is the most challenging numeric conversion in the
test set. The value "85,00,000.00" must be parsed as 8,500,000.00 in Western notation.
Additionally, the date "05/02/2024" is ambiguous -- it could be May 2 (US format) or
February 5 (Indian/European format). The training data includes Indian-format dates
but the model may not have seen enough examples to reliably choose DD/MM over MM/DD.
Only 5 of the 80 training examples use Indian numbering, and the largest unit price
in training is Rs. 28,50,000.00, which is significantly smaller than the values here.

## Proposed Data Fix

Add 3 training examples with INR values exceeding one crore (1,00,00,000.00) to
familiarize the model with large-scale Indian number formatting. Add 2 examples
where the date is in DD/MM/YYYY format with a day value greater than 12 (e.g., 15/03)
to unambiguously teach DD/MM preference for Indian documents.
